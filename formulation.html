              <p>Tablets have several advantages over other formulations that make it the most desirable formulation for our product. These advantages are that tablets are easier for patients to take (increasing patient compliance), easier to manufacture in bulk, and easier to distribute <a href="#1">(1)</a>.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>The manufacturing of tablets requires both the active pharmacological ingredient (API) and the excipients. Pharmaceutical excipients are the substances that are included in a pharmaceutical dosage form, they are usually inert which means they do not have any pharmacological activity, the main reason for adding them is to aid the manufacturing process, by enhancing stability, sometimes increasing bioavailability, and patient acceptability <a href="#2">(2)</a> <a href="#3">(3)</a>.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Disintegration Time should be 6 minutes and dissolution 75% in 30 minutes, disintegration and dissolution are very important concepts in tablet manufacturing because each drug particle must be dissolved to be absorbed.</p>
              <p>Hardness: 9.5kg, the hardness properties of the tablet help the patients to get two solid halves when they snap the tablets in half.</p>
              <p>Abrasion/Friability: 0.3% because tablets get made thousands per second. Tablets need to be robust so that when they go through a conveyor belt they donâ€™t break or get damaged.</p>
              <p>The formulation of the Newloserine tablet is for the phase 1 clinical trial, so the concentration of the API will be the minimum therapeutic dose (MTD) based on the preclinical trials.</p>

            <p class="title is-4 has-text-danger">Binders</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6">Adding a binder helps to bind all ingredients together to give a shape for the tablet, and it helps in the compaction process which can be identified as the process that transforms the powder or granules into a coherent dosage form <a href="#1">(1)</a>. Binder agents play an important role in the dissolution rate, in other words, a higher concentration of the binder agent means a higher dissolution rate.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Microcrystalline Cellulose</p>

            <p class="title is-4 has-text-warning">Disintegrants</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6">The main function of the disintegration agent is to help in the dispersion of the tablet in the gastrointestinal tract which helps in releasing the active ingredient and increasing the surface area for dissolution. Therefore, a high disintegrant concentration will decrease the disintegration time. The mechanism of action of sodium starch glycolate occurs by drawing water into the tablet using capillary action and then swelling to force the tablet apart by excreting internal pressure <a href="#1">(1)</a>.</p>

            <p class="subtitle is-6">Granulating agents can be added to improve the flow of both the active ingredient and the excipient, glidant is a very small divided particle ( less than 50 nm), have the ability to absorb moisture and can be absorbed into the surface of the larger powder, as a result, there will be an increase in the minimal contact distance and reducing the contact area between the larger particles, which will lead to a reduction in the van der Waals forces and that gives the powder the ability to aggregate <a href="#1">(1)</a>.</p>

            <p class="subtitle is-6">Tablet formulations need the addition of the lubricant, to reduce the friction between the powder or granules and the surface of the tableting machine. Lubricants play an important role in deciding the final hardness of the tablets, low lubricant concentration gives a hard tablet <a href="#1">(1)</a> <a href="#3">(3)</a>.</p>
