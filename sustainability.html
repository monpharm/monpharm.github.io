      <p>Issues of sustainability and social responsibility hold an utmost importance upon pharmaceutical discovery and development of a disease and sequential drug production. These responsibilities can differ however are mostly closely related for both (Disease and Drug production) and can be explained via selected sustainable development goals (SDG) promoted by the United Nations (UN) and followed according to standards set by the International Organisation for standardisation (ISO). </p>

      <p>UN’s goal number 3 of ‘Good health and Well-being’ in particular target 3.4 aims to reduce mortalities from non-communicable diseases via their treatment and prevention to stimulate good mental health and well-being (United Nations, 2021a). Schizophrenia, a non-communicable mental disorder (World Health Organization, 2002) is implicated to be a key sustainability issue due to its severe impact on mental well-being of individuals (Votruba & Thornicroft, 2016). In absence of good mental health, individuals are unable to perform daily living tasks, which is a risk factor for income and education inequality, nutrition attainment and social exclusion (World Health Organization., 2018). In particular, those diagnosed with Schizophrenia, heavily suffer through thoughts of suicide (Singh et al., 2008) and increased complications with family relationships (Hooley, 2010) which in turn reduces an individuals quality of life and represents devalued well-being. In order to alleviate these consequential negative effects of Schizophrenia, for Australia it is aimed to list our drug on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) run by the Australian Government. This would allow Australians residents currently holding medicare card an access to a pocket friendly government-subsidised price for the medication (Australian Government, 2020). Furthermore, it is aimed to have the drug readily available in pharmacies across the world, wherein country’s respective health department can be contacted to seek schemes such as PBS.  </p>

      <p>Potential social responsibility (SR) issues derived for our drug can be managed by ISO 26000 which is a voluntary based guidance document which sets standards for SR. These include managing any labour and operating practises, effects of production on the environment due to waste and lastly overall development benefit to the community.  (Going to add paragraph on consumer/responsility to create quality medication as SR)</p>

      <p>The working conditions in which the drug is produced can prose a potential risk for physical injury or psychological burden (work related stress) for the workers plus any potential hazards in handling modified d-cycloserine are hypothesised from the original d-cycloserine. These include skin, eye and respiratory tract irritation upon inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption (ThermoFisher, 2009). This SR can be managed via following section 6.4.6.2 of ISO 26000 (ISO, 2010). Production site would ensure sufficient ventilation and usage of personal protective equipment would be mandatory for workers. Moreover a health and safety policy will be introduced which adheres to the potential risks analysed for workers. Any incidents would be recorded and a respective prevention strategy would be added to the policy. Workers would be invited to complete monthly surveys to record level of work stress using the perceived stress scale (Cohen, 1994) in order to manage workload. </p>

      <p>Production of medication would generate wastage from the use of resources which poses a SR issue. This could involve disposal of active ingredient - modified d-cycloserine. In order to prevent any negative environmental consequences, calculated quantities of ingredients would be used. If any excess is noted, chemical modifications would be conducted to ensure no hazardous materials (ozone depleting substances or organic pollutants) are disposed.  Renewable energy sources would be used to reduce any carbon emissions. This prevents the sustainability issue of climate change caused by the using non renewable energy sources and helps achieve UNs goal 12 - Responsible consumption and production with goal 13 - Climate Action (United Nations, 2021b) (United Nations, 2022). </p>
