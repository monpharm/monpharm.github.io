              <p>Tablets have several advantages over other formulations that make it the most desirable formulation for our product. These advantages are that tablets are easier for patients to take (increasing patient compliance), easier to manufacture in bulk, and easier to distribute <a href="#1">(1)</a>.</p>

              <p>The manufacturing of tablets requires both the active pharmacological ingredient (API) and the excipients. Pharmaceutical excipients are the substances that are included in a pharmaceutical dosage form, they are usually inert which means they do not have any pharmacological activity, the main reason for adding them is to aid the manufacturing process, by enhancing stability, sometimes increasing bioavailability, and patient acceptability <a href="#2">(2)</a> <a href="#3">(3)</a>.</p>

              <p>Disintegration Time should be 6 minutes and dissolution 75% in 30 minutes, disintegration and dissolution are very important concepts in tablet manufacturing because each drug particle must be dissolved to be absorbed.</p>
              <p>Hardness: 9.5kg, the hardness properties of the tablet help the patients to get two solid halves when they snap the tablets in half.</p>
              <p>Abrasion/Friability: 0.3% because tablets get made thousands per second. Tablets need to be robust so that when they go through a conveyor belt they don’t break or get damaged.</p>
              <p>The formulation of the Newloserine tablet is for the phase 1 clinical trial, so the concentration of the API will be the minimum therapeutic dose (MTD) based on the preclinical trials.</p>

            <p class="subtitle is-6">Adding a binder helps to bind all ingredients together to give a shape for the tablet, and it helps in the compaction process which can be identified as the process that transforms the powder or granules into a coherent dosage form <a href="#1">(1)</a>. Binder agents play an important role in the dissolution rate, in other words, a higher concentration of the binder agent means a higher dissolution rate.</p>

            <p class="title is-4 has-text-warning">Disintegrants</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6">The main function of the disintegration agent is to help in the dispersion of the tablet in the gastrointestinal tract which helps in releasing the active ingredient and increasing the surface area for dissolution. Therefore, a high disintegrant concentration will decrease the disintegration time. The mechanism of action of sodium starch glycolate occurs by drawing water into the tablet using capillary action and then swelling to force the tablet apart by excreting internal pressure <a href="#1">(1)</a>.</p>

            <p class="subtitle is-6">Granulating agents can be added to improve the flow of both the active ingredient and the excipient, glidant is a very small divided particle ( less than 50 nm), have the ability to absorb moisture and can be absorbed into the surface of the larger powder, as a result, there will be an increase in the minimal contact distance and reducing the contact area between the larger particles, which will lead to a reduction in the van der Waals forces and that gives the powder the ability to aggregate <a href="#1">(1)</a>.</p>

            <p class="subtitle is-6">Tablet formulations need the addition of the lubricant, to reduce the friction between the powder or granules and the surface of the tableting machine.

          <p>One other possible formulation could be injectable solutions. Injectable solutions are injected into the human body by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous in order to administer target disease. Compared to oral tablet formulations, injectables show a faster onset of action, and with a higher bioavailability as it bypasses the absorption barrier of oral medications <a href="#4">(4)</a>. Likewise, Patients who had been treated by long-acting injections therapies provided evidence on offering better tolerability and efficacy than the oral treatment <a href="#5">(5)</a>. The reason for choosing an injectable solution is that D-cycloserine is only given orally. Our new compound – Newloserine, should be considered to design not only an oral taking but also suitable for injection. It helps patients with problems taking Newloserine orally (e.g. stupefaction or unconsciousness). The advantages of injection such as the high affinity and efficacy may majority target on the acute symptoms in patients.</p>
          <p>Injectable solutions have to be sterile and always kept at a low temperature. Producing and developing injectable solutions should consider stability, toxicity, pH range, solubility, drug concentration and excipient proportion <a href="#4">(4)</a>.</p>
          <p>Excipients are the important factor in the development of an injectable solution either. There are 8 different types of excipients for use in injectable solutions. Which include solvents or co-solvents, agents for increasing solubility, chelating agents, pH adjusting agents, reducing or antioxidants agents, antimicrobial preservatives, bulking agents, and special additives <a href="#6">(6)</a>.</p>
