    <p>After the discovery and preclinical research of our new drug, the next step will be to perform studies on humans (i.e. clinical trials). The basic goal of clinical trials is to test the effectiveness, dosage, and safety of a new drug in humans. Clinical trials always start after receiving the approval from the community of health authority and ethics in the country or area where the drug is registered. Before the start of a clinical trial, researchers need to design a protocol which includes the major research questions and aims. The protocol will be developed by both the drug researcher and manufacturer and must be fully understood and signed by participants (i.e. informed consent) <a href="#1">(1)</a>. Clinical trials usually have four different phases, which are phase I to IV.</p>

In phase II trials, the drug will usually be tested against a placebo control group. This process will take from several months to at least two years.</p>

          <p>After being marketed to the general patients, post market monitoring is important. Drug advertising may affect the sales of the drug and further affect the benefit of the manufacturer. Manufacturer inspection is to ensure the drug always be produced under criterion. Intellectual property (IP) situation of the drug is important to prevent generic drugs, it helps to protect the manufacturer's benefit.</p>
