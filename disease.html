          <p class="title">What is Schizophrenia?</p>
          <p>Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health disease that is characterised by neurological alterations that lead to symptoms that affect the quality of life in patients (2). While the exact cause of schizophrenia is still unknown, there are risk factors such as frequent exposure to toxic chemicals that would increase the risk of developing the disease (3). In terms of neurological activity, schizophrenia is characterised by overstimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors (9). It is common to observe different combinations of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (2), which are listed below:</p>

      <p class="title">NMDA Recptors in Schizophrenia</p>
      <p>While dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors are the main target for many typical and atypical antipsychotic medications available, NMDA receptors would be an alternative target that is worth considering. This is because current antipsychotic medication poses various side effects (9). NMDA receptors are ion-channels that have subunits that could be pharmacologically beneficial for treatments for schizophrenia (10). Three biological models were used to validate the target. Since it is hard to create schizophrenic mouse models due to the subjective nature of the disease, symptoms of the disease are replicated instead. </p>

              <p>The first mouse model would be to socially isolate the mouse to stimulate one of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which is social withdrawal. The mouse is administered with a NMDA agonist and introduced to other mice and the response in social interaction of the mouse is compared to the rest of the mice in the control group. The experimental flow would be as shown in the image below.</p>
