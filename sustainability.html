        <p>Issues of sustainability and social responsibility hold the utmost importance upon pharmaceutical discovery and development of a disease and sequential drug production. These responsibilities can differ however are mostly closely selected sustainable development goals (SDG) promoted by the United Nations (UN) and followed according to standards set by the International Organisation for standardisation (ISO).</p>

        <p class="title has-text-primary">Sustainability Issues - Overseen by UN Goal Number 3</p>
        <p>UN’s goal number 3 of ‘Good Health and Well-being’, in particular Target 3.4, aims to reduce mortalities from non-communicable diseases via their treatment and prevention to stimulate good mental health and well-being (7).</p>
